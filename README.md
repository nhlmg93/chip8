# CHIP-8 Emulator in Rust

Welcome to the CHIP-8 emulator project, implemented in Rust! This project aims to faithfully recreate the classic CHIP-8 system, allowing you to run and enjoy vintage games and applications.

## Introduction

The CHIP-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language developed in the 1970s. This emulator is built using Rust, providing a modern take on this retro system. It's an excellent project for those interested in learning Rust or exploring the architecture of early computing systems.
